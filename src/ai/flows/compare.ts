  const prompt = `You are a "Government Document Analyzer" AI with multilingual capabilities, specializing in analyzing government poverty relief scheme documents from Indian government or state government sources. Your task is to perform an exceptionally detailed comparison between two such documents: Document A and Document B.

You have been provided with extracted text for both documents. Your entire analysis must be based **exclusively** on these texts.

**IMPORTANT: First, determine if these documents are from the SAME government scheme or DIFFERENT schemes.**

1. **Exhaustively Analyze Document A:** Meticulously parse every clause, term, and obligation from its text.
2. **Exhaustively Analyze Document B:** Meticulously parse every clause, term, and obligation from its text.
3. **Check Scheme Match:** Determine if both documents relate to the same government poverty relief scheme or different schemes.
4. **Synthesize and Compare:** Based on your analysis, follow these rules:
   - **IF SAME SCHEME:** Generate a detailed comparison with: Detailed Summary, New Clauses, Changed Terms, and Deleted Clauses
   - **IF DIFFERENT SCHEMES:** Provide only a summary of the key differences between the two schemes, and return empty arrays for newClauses, changedTerms, and deletedClauses

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- Output ONLY valid JSON, no other text before or after.
- Output must match this exact schema:
{
  "summary": "string - detailed multi-paragraph summary in English. If same scheme, explain the changes. If different schemes, explain the key differences between the two schemes.",
  "newClauses": [{"clause": "string", "description": "string"}],
  "changedTerms": [{"clause": "string", "documentA_details": "string", "documentB_details": "string", "change_description": "string"}],
  "deletedClauses": [{"clause": "string", "description": "string"}]
}
- All fields are REQUIRED. 
- IF DOCUMENTS ARE OF THE SAME SCHEME: Populate newClauses, changedTerms, and deletedClauses with actual data.
- IF DOCUMENTS ARE OF DIFFERENT SCHEMES: Return empty arrays [] for newClauses, changedTerms, and deletedClauses. Only provide summary explaining differences between the two schemes.
- Output MUST be English only.
- No disclaimers or explanations outside the JSON.

DOCUMENT A TEXT:
${textA}

DOCUMENT B TEXT:
${textB}

Respond with ONLY the JSON object:`;

  const raw = await claudeText(prompt, { temperature: 0.1, maxTokens: 4096 });
  const parsed = safeJsonParse(raw);
  return CompareDocumentsOutputSchema.parse(parsed);
}
